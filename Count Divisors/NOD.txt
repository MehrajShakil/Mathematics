We know a number greater than 1 can be represented as product of prime numbers.

that is n = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * p3^e3 ...............pk^ek.

nod(n) = (e1+1)*(e2+1)*(e3+1)........(ek+1)

let n = 12
d(n) = 1 ,2 ,3, 4, 6, 12
     = 6
     
 nod(12) = 2^2 * 3^1
         = (2+1) * (1+1)
         = 3*2
         = 6
