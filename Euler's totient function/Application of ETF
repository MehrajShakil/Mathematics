The most famous and important property of Euler's totient function is expressed in Euler's theorem:

a^phi(m) % m = 1.
Here a and m are co-prime.

In particular case when m is prime, Euler's theorem turns into Fermat's little theorem,
a ^ ( m - 1 ) % m = 1.
a ^ ( m - 1 ) congrunce a ^ ( n % phi ( m ) ) % m.
